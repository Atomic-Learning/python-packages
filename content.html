<p>A Python package is a collection of code that is bundled together to provide specific functionality. Packages help organize code and make it reusable across different projects.</p>

<p>The most common way to use packages in Python is by downloading and installing them from an online repository, such as the <a href="https://pypi.org/" rel="noopener noreferrer" target="_blank">Python Package Index (PyPI)</a>. Packages can be installed using package management tools like <code>pip</code>. Many packages available this way are open-source and maintained by the Python community, and they can be easily integrated into your projects to add new features or simplify complex tasks. Using packages in this way is a common and effective method to enhance your Python applications. Common examples of popular Python packages include:</p>

<ul>
<li><strong>NumPy</strong>: A package for numerical computing and working with arrays.</li>
<li><strong>Pandas</strong>: A package for data manipulation and analysis.</li>
<li><strong>Matplotlib</strong>: A package for creating static, animated, and interactive visualizations in Python.</li>
</ul>

<p>Packages can also be defined within a single directory as part of the code of a larger project, as part of the process of managing complexity in larger codebases.</p>
